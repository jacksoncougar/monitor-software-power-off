# Nightshade

Nightshade helps you work smarter by forcing you to take breaks throughout the day. 
It works by turning the power off on your monitors after you have been working for 
a while then turning them back on after you've taken a break. Rinse and repeat.

If you've ever struggled with taking breaks, found secondary tasks lagging behind, 
or feel overworked this might be the solution for you.
